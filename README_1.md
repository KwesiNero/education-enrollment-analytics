# Education Performance & Enrollment Risk Analysis  
**Using a Public Kaggle Dataset**

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes publicly available education data to uncover patterns in student performance and demographic factors. The goal is to demonstrate how schools, IT teams, and EdTech platforms can use data analytics to identify academic risk, plan targeted interventions, and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Business Problem  
Schools and education platforms often struggle to:
- Identify students at academic risk early  
- Understand how socioeconomic factors influence performance  
- Allocate resources and support programs effectively  

This analysis simulates how education data can be used to address these challenges.

## Data Source  
- **Dataset:** Students Performance in Exams  
- **Source:** Kaggle (public dataset)  
- **Records:** 1,000 students  

> This dataset is used for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only.

## Methodology  
1. Data loading and validation  
2. Data cleaning and column standardization  
3. Feature engineering (average score)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Performance risk segmentation  
6. Insight generation
